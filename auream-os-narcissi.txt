Aureum os narcissi

In times as real estate, tries clumsy stately craft
A screeching eagle-tweagle, from golden nest so daft.

By tweets by-passing media, the brute cuts to critique
Excoriated pulsing chest, of 'corpus politique'.

Will pass at octoginta age, and still-in-power be.
Maximo Lead, American.
Del Norte. Boss for thee.

In history books, a by-line reads : 

"The tweagle ate their heart. 
 Resuscitation was too late, the country fell apart."

My fingers / crossed / and pointed :

"Behold the eagled sky!
 Like PhoenÄ«x comes, the kindest kind,
 like star dust on the pie ..."
